## Simulation of lagrangian particles in a fluid flow

☑️ Particles are assumed to be spherical.

☑️ One-way coupling between fluid and particles is considered, so there is no particle collision modeling in this code.

☑️ The fluid velocity field has to be pre-set.

There are two similar codes available here:

<li>
  lagrangian_particles: This code is setup based on the motion of small particles in a cellular flow field <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.866206">(Maxey, 1987)</a>.
</li>
<li>
  lagrangian_particles_bubble: This is based on a flow of air bubbles in a two-dimensional channel.
</li>

In addition to the case setup, the difference between the codes lies in the calculation of the forces acting on the particles and the types of boundary condition available.

👩🏻‍🎓 These codes were developed during my graduate studies.
